Welcome to the game Breakout!
This timeless game will keep you entertained, working to break those bricks!
The mouse controls the sliding bar at the bottom and the goal is to bounce the ball back up before it touches the bottom. Each time you touch the base you lose a life and after 3 lives, the game resets! Break all the bricks and you have won!
